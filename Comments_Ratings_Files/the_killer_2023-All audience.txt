Comment: This movie is in keeping with Fincher's detached, OCD directing style. The main character has no emotional depth, so we are forced to watch a picture reliant on process--how he eats, sleeps, buys plane tickets, rents cars, puts on hats, takes showers, rolls a recycling bin in and out of a truck, orders a box on Amazon, and so on. After a while, it gets repetitive. His motivations in the latter portion of the movie rely on his love interest getting horribly attacked. But it has no emotional payoff. We aren't led to care about their relationship. In fact, they are hardly shown being together. I get the sense the act of violence toward her was deleted from the movie, since it would have been too much to bear. Perhaps most unforgivable of all, the ending is a letdown. It feels like the filmmakers ran out of time or money. Probably not the case. The movie was capable of true catharsis but instead made different choices. Well made and acted but ultimately disappointing.

Comment: Beyond boring....hard to understand the revenge plot...maybe I dozed off at that scene.  Only reason for 2 star are the killing scenes which were great.   But seen the revenge thing in numerous other movies. And no way he misses killing the Target in the beginning of the movie. Not realistic.

Rating: 3.5
Comment: A compelling revenge story of a ruthless assassin. It's grim, cynical, masterfully crafted, and morbidly fascinating. I suspect many won't find it satisfying as the killer's actions are reprehensible throughout. There is no moral arc that permits the viewer to sympathize with or root for the main character. Reminds me of Unforgiven...there is no protagonist, it is simply a story.

Comment: This is such a strange film. As strange as "Uncut Gems" but without any of the tension. I mean, Fincher is Fincher and Fassbender is Fassbender, which is enough to sell it. It looks great in parts and the fight sequence in Florida is excellent. But for the rest, it is so sloooow, especially the first 20 minutes where nothing happens. It could be part of the schtick - like in "Pulp Fiction" where Tarantino shows killers chatting about movies and eating burgers just like you and me, it also shows that killers could be anywhere and being a successful killer takes discipline and patience - which is exactly what it takes to get through this film. Ultimately, that's the problem: at the end you're not sure if you've watched a work of art or merely a tedious film. A few days later after watching it and thinking about it, and I'm still not sure. But here I am writing about it. So, maybe it's not so tedious after all...

Comment: I had high hopes for this movie and was a little disappointed that it lacked so much of the action that might have made it a different film. The main character was like a zombie the entire time, and not a very smart one.  I did like the voice over aspect of the movie, it was interesting to know what was going through his mind/ I assume that came from the way the book was written.

Comment: I'd like my 2 hours back. Was hoping for an edge of my sofa thriller, but the pace is so slow I nodded off during the opening scenes, and the plot seemed thin and stilted.  Some good action scenes, of course, and the odd bit of humor, but overall did not live up to the hype.

Rating: 2
Comment: A very average film that thinks it is cleverer and more stylish than it really is.  It's about the storytelling and the writers, the vacant character development, the lack of originality or ideas (even the joke told in the film I had heard before).  It seems that this generation of films really have no ground to stand on and no particular aspirations to exceed.  Is it just the generation of films, I wonder?  Too bad they used a Smiths soundtrack, The Smiths deserve much, much better.

Rating: 4.5
Comment: üçÖ 9.1/10This was a very anticipated film for me, and it did not disappoint. This is much more of a thriller than an action film, but it succeeds very well at it. It's a paranoia thriller that has a great performance by Michael Fasbender, and the movie feels very lived in pls don't skip on the killer.

Rating: 3
Comment: During the first 30 minutes of the movie I was expecting something that never happened. Would like to see the full opening scene without the narration. Did not love the content of the main character ideas but the imagery is good. The ending is a little boring. The Smith`s tunes/lyrics were a good choice. Maybe a better sequel?

Rating: 4
Comment: I admit that anything that stars Tilda Swinton is already at 4 out of 5 stars for me. That said, this movie righteously earned it's 4 stars.  It's narrated by the main character played by Fassbender. And despite a quirky repeating of his assassin's mantra for most of that narration, it works. His American accent didn't work for me, but the script was compelling. The character clearly is OCD in multiple ways and seems as cold and methodical as a dry ice machine. And yet, he has love in his weird life a la the revenge aspect of the plot.  Swinton's role is small but scene-chewy (of course).  If you like the pace of movies like The Counselor and The Conversation (oldy but goody), you will like this movie in a 4-star way.

Comment: An absolutely meaningless film. The main character lurches from killing to killing in an over-filtered world to the soundtrack of the Smiths and a narration of emotionless perfection. Ironic, since it was his own mistake that got him into his situation in the first place. Apparently he knows the rules of the game but yet he's somehow taken it personally and is now on a path of pointless revenge. There's no meaning or explanation for anything that happens in this film which makes it very difficult to actually care about the journey.

Comment: The Killer brings back memories of David Fincher's early films. This is a fun and intriguing subversion of the stereotypical hitman movie, a richly fascinating study of social and economic class. The film portrays Michael Fassbender as a cold, methodical, and objective character. A unique perspective on the psyche and lifestyle of a calculated contract killer who has both nothing and everything to lose is given to us. Fincher's meticulous direction and Fassbender's reserved performance elevate this to a top-tier level. He reminds himself throughout the movie to be emotionless, anticipate everything, and strive for perfection in everything he does. We're not listening to a man describe why he's the perfect hitman. We're listening to a man trying to be the perfect killer and trying to think like a sociopathic hitman. He's not describing himself in his monologues, but rather the person he wants to be, regardless of his flaws. The film consists of excellent cinematography, editing, score, and sound. The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but it doesn't really need to be. While this is a basic investigation and revenge setup that we've seen before, the aesthetic that Fincher produces makes it difficult to care. I would say that the motivations of this character seem a little underdeveloped. His stoicism is deliberate. To fully understand the journey he is on, I felt like I needed to gain a greater understanding of his personal life. Michael Fassbender chose the right movie to return to. It's been some time since we last saw him on the big screen, but he made it apparent that we were missing him with this movie. Despite my issues with the script, I enjoyed this movie. It would have been great if the story had been expanded a lot more. It's worth watching.

Comment: The Killer is a simple movie about a killer that messes up his last contract, feels the consequences, but now wants to get revenge for a mess up that he did. It's a funny concept if you think about it: the killer sees himself as a perfect role model in a dying society, but he is cynical, he thinks he is always right.The movie itself is a great inner-monologue in which the killer explain his life style, his motivations, his beliefs. At some point, it kind feels like dark humor; in fact, most of the movie is dark humor: again, the killer's motivation is his pursue for revenge for having been payed off due to his mistake, a dumb mistake for someone that meticulously keeps flattering himself.Overall, this is a nice movie to watch, but with a meh main character. Though the killer is nice, he ends up becoming too dark for no reason, which diminishes his overall charisma. In the end, we keep watching because the scenes are well-writen.The Killer is a good movie to watch on a casual day, but don't expect more than a violent story with a style that remembers Knives' Out. Though Michael Fassbender steals the show, it's not enough to get more than 6 stars.

Comment: This film is an audiobook with pictures. Dude talks constantly to himself, meanwhile nothing happens (e.g. in first 15 minutes of the film, he just looks here and there and can't stop talking). There is very little meaningful action, most of the fights are boring, and you can just fast forward those. When the "hero" does not talk to himself, someone else does a 5 minute long boring monologue without taking a breath.At least if the personal and other monologues were good, we could call it a filmed monodrama or similar, but no. You literally want to fast forward all the nonsense he says. If he was quiet the entire time in the film, at least we would have something like John Wick.Wasted talents, wasted potential, wasted time to watch it.

Comment: I cannot believe the high ratings for this movie. In the first 25 minutes you'll listen to the main character think to himself. That's it. No dialogue with any other person. When the contractor finally gets his gun ready to shoot someone, he shoots the wrong person. Then nothing really happens after that. I'm annoyed with myself for the lack of judgment of wasting my time watching this as long as I did.

Comment: Always a fan of Fincher, especially for his tone. He easily makes his films with a sense of darkness, mood and angst that others work for years to achieve on his level. What pleasantly surprised me about this work was how much it made me laugh. I'll be thinking about this film when this year ends and likely when awards season begins.

Rating: 4.5
Comment: Great film that focuses on the internal drama as much as the action, hewing to a more realistic take on the elite assassin character. How this gets low ratings, but the horrible John Wick 4 or The Gray Man get better viewer ratings... just goes to show most movie fans are mouth breathing idiots. This reminded me of The American (George Clooney) in that it was actually a suspenseful character movie, not an action film. The Killer was a more modern take on the existential questions and attempted justification of murder (rather than the paranoid '70s drama feel of The American), but they both tread similar ground.Good stuff from Fincher and Fassbender.

Comment: It's a slow-burner, with a low, gruff, slightly mumbled narration throughout, which does take some getting used to. Of course, with DF at the helm, you are aware that what you're seeing and hearing will have a purpose, and will deliver in the end. And this does. Unfortunately it's not got the electricity of suspense you feel it could have. However, a solid example of directing and acting it is

Comment: Slightly disappointing given I came into it with high expectations from the director of Fight Club and many others. But judging it in a vacuum it was a solid movie and well worth the watch. In my opinion the particular strength of this film was the hopelessness and desperation by the "protagonist's" victims that conveyed what it must feel like to know with certainty that you are facing your last minutes on earth. That alone made the film memorable to me. Better than some dumbass Marvel flick.

Comment: To me, the movie was very well acted and the writing was pretty good overall but with a tendency to to stretch dialogue down to lines so spare and drawn out as to be almost painful to listen to. I found no characters to sympathize with with the exception of some of the collateral damage. But the innocents weren't developed enough to really care and I had half hoped that they would be integrated into the story but, no.  I wouldn't recommend this over the John Wick films or, more seriously, Day of The Jackal or In Bruges. Other than a pretty straight revenge story I didn't see the point. Fassbender was great, just unable to wish his character anything except dead!

Comment: This story follows a generic brand psychopath on a mission to avenge his generic brand beautiful wife. That's it. You won't find any intrigue and mystery here, just a cliche revenge plot. The protagonist's only quality is being evil, in the most boring way possible, and sadly none of the action sequences or other characters are exciting enough (not even Tilda Swinton!) to distract you from this fact.Some of the cinematography is pretty good, but style is no substitute for substance. The soundtrack is also pretty good, heavily featuring The Smiths, but you'll barely get to hear it because you'll be forced to listen to his incessant and profoundly trite voiceover, delivered with all the personality and charisma of a shoebox.What exactly was the point of this movie? The protagonist is extremely unlikeable and is not at all unique enough for a "window into a twisted mind" angle. There's nothing original here. You've heard this nihilistic philosophy before. The only enjoyment I took from this film is writing this review. Consider skipping this one.

Comment: David Fincher's latest film, "The Killer," somehow feels like an action thriller while also being a satire of one. I think this made it an interesting viewing experience. I think Michael Fassbender presents a character that does a lot of crazy things and I found myself curious to see what he would do next. The story itself felt a bit all over the place to me, and as someone who hasn't read the book that inspired it, I felt a bit underwhelmed by the time it ended. I enjoyed the ride but didn't feel any real satisfaction from any of the events in the story. Overall, I would say this is a lower-tier Fincher movie, but it is still a good and unique one that continues to diversify his excellent filmography.

Rating: 2.5
Comment: The "you missed the point by idealizing them" club just got a brand new member with this new offering of  David Fincher. Fincher's career is very uneven, a lot of triumphs and a lot of low points. This one, to me, sits squarely in the middle. As a procedural, it is very pleasurable to watch. As thriller it really can make you all tense with anticipation/ As drama it demonstrates really well the depths of one man's depravity and is a chilling reminder that some of us have very different values and general worldview than is socially acceptable. As an action film, it is slow, but has some really good sequences and one impressively shoot fight-scene. The magnificent Tilda Swinton comes in for a minute to steal one particular scene then promptly leaves to other projects. Its main vice to me is a one big SPOILER, so do not read any further if you haven't watched already. If you had, I grievance is that somehow the main character is able to secure a happy, idyllic ending to himself and his loved one. It is immensely silly. People like him do not have happy endings, nor they deserve one.

Rating: 1.5
Comment: This film is very much a case of style over substance. The titular killer, played by Michael Fassbender, is an incredibly dull and pretentious character in whose company the audience is expected to suffer as he goes through the process of his work. He also endlessly pontificates via an internal monologue about his bland nihilistic philosophy and other tiresome musings. Despite good cinematography and acting, the film is, above all, deeply boring and alienating to watch.

Comment: ‚úÖ75%David Fincher's The Killer is one of the most technically perfect movies of the year. The sound design, the score, the cinematography, the editing, it's all great.Michael Fassbender gives a great performance that doesn't require much talking, but more stillness and serenity. The movie puts you in the guy's mindset and takes you on his journey.The one action scene is fantastic, one of the best scenes of the year.The plot was mixed for me. I thought the first half was amazing. Thrilling, calculated, and the pacing was flowing well. The second half, though, was a bit all over the place for me. The movie didn't care much to explain the names of characters and who they were. Sometimes I could guess it but, sometimes I realized I wasn't sure where the killer was going and what was his purpose. The ending felt a bit anticlimactic but it closed off the movie in somewhat of a happy note.The Killer is well acted and thrilling, and even though the first half is better than the second, this movie is a technical masterpiece.

Comment: The Killer is a sparse, slick and stylish psychological thriller. David Fincher is a director with an impeccable reputation. His films are usually thoughtful, exacting and also entertaining. His latest is no different, even if might not be absolute top tier for him. In this quietly observant film, we follow a nameless hit man, one we only know as 'The Killer'. He is extremely meticulous and methodical. He erases all evidence of himself as he goes. He listens constantly to The Smiths and checks into hotels using the names of classic sitcom characters. His first job in the film is in Paris. But when it doesn't go right it sets off a chain of events where he needs to make good and find justice. The film is carved up into six chapters/locations. Paris, Dominican Republic, New Orleans, Florida, Boston and Chicago. Each one is a thrilling set piece that is both gripping and suspenseful. The film is stylish to a fault, although you could say it is fairly surface level. But it moves with such purpose and elan that it is all quite mesmerising. The great Michael Fassbender is well cast as the lonely man who moves through the world like a shadow. His voiceover gives us a glimpse into a man who believes the world is empty and cruel. Aided by a throbbing score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross this is a very impressive film that entertains in its own very dark way.

Comment: Michael Fassbender plays an unnamed assassin in David Fincher's hitman thriller, The Killer. He is methodical, disciplined, and without scruples or regrets. The film follows the killer as he waits for his next target, speaks to us on the soundtrack about his methodology and philosophy, and embarks on an international manhunt after a fateful near-miss.The main concept of The Killer is that the hitman is a representation of a coldly methodical assassin due to his cool finesse, professional punctuality, and serial killer-like tendencies. The movie owes much to both the sleek cynicism of Fincher's own past work and the mythology of the assassin in movies. The plot takes a very Taken-esque turn when the killer's partner is assaulted to within an inch of her life, and he embarks on a rearguard action for his own survival that takes him from Paris to the Dominican Republic to New Orleans to Florida to New York to Chicago. The film never matches its opening sequence for sheer screw-tightening excitement, but it has a satisfyingly grim momentum to the businesslike body count.Michael Fassbender delivers a dead-eyed and dread-squeezed performance as the killer, speaking in a low, affectless drone and sounding as controlled as Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. He is fanatically focused on his mission of vengeance and self-defense, but something goes terribly wrong for no reason at all, and he must act decisively to survive. In a brief but sly cameo, Tilda Swinton plays a lawyer who gave the go-ahead to attack the killer's partner. Her scenes are funnier, smarter, and more stylish than the entire movie.The two hours of the film are filled with David Fincher's signature style, and simply because of the calibre of the crew that produced it, it hums like few recent films of its kind. The film offers a sense of detail and is finely tuned, like one of the killer's jobs. With a brilliant running gag about the assassin's fictitious names and a parade of well-known companies like Starbucks, Amazon, WeWork, and even Wordle, the film's cinematography is sleek and fashionable.The Killer is a thriller of pure surface and style, but it falls short of expectations due to its hollow plot and uninspired writing. The film is entertaining to watch, but it lacks the emotional depth and character development that would make it truly memorable. The historical and cultural backdrop of the movie is a critique of a society that has become so commercialised and cold that a murderer can go unnoticed because everyone is too preoccupied with other things to notice him or her. The film's tone is cold and calculating, and it made me feel detached and uninvolved in the story. The Killer is a decent hitman thriller that is worth watching if you're a fan of David Fincher's work or the genre in general. However, if you're looking for a film with emotional depth, character development, or a compelling plot, you might want to look elsewhere.

Comment: Fantastic!!! A movie like this in the hands of other director, would be just simple, but David Fincher knows how to make a really good character study and use the technnal elements to create a claustofobic and brutal movie that when goes hard doesn't stop. The Florida's sequence is already classic. Overall is a really great movie with a consistent act by Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton.

Comment: The Killers is an experimental addition to one of the most impressive and iconic filmographies of all time, that will be studied by filmmakers for generations to come - David Fincher's.I personally find a lot of parallels between him and Wes Anderson - 2 extreme perfectionists with the most narrowest yet concrete vision of what they want to potray on the silver screen. Every scene, every cut, every dialogue, every shot blocking, every musical and lighting cue has been directed to utter precision, as they serve their own miniscule roles and combine in harmony to form these gigantic orchestral presentations. Despite its flaws, this film emerges as an extraordinary piece of art, reflecting an unparalleled commitment to perfectionism.

Comment: David Fincher's "The Killer," a film adaptation of a '90s French graphic novel, teams up with Michael Fassbender to deliver a uniquely chilling thriller. The movie shines with the crisp cinematography of Erik Messerschmidt and the haunting soundtrack crafted by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross. It's evident that the use of the Red V-Raptor  and Leitz SUMMILUX-C lenses pays off, with each frame painting a stunning picture.Yet, the film doesn't quite hit the perfect mark. Despite my love for The Smiths, their songs seem out of place here. The plot is a straight line that leaves you expecting more at the end, especially with its oversimplified take on the class divide, seemingly preaching a tired "forgive the rich, blame the poor" message.The revenge story at the film's heart feels underdeveloped. Fassbender, undeniably skilled, is confined to a script that offers him scant dialogue, reducing his role to a series of mantras rather than a fully fleshed-out character. It's a testament to his talent that he remains compelling, even when the script does not.There's a sense that the original script might have offered more, but perhaps due to time, budget, or the constraints of filming during the pandemic's peak, it feels trimmed down to its detriment.In essence, "The Killer" is a visually arresting film with a standout lead performance that is let down by its simplicity and an underwhelming narrative. It scores a solid 3.5/5, not quite a masterpiece but definitely a piece with masterful touches.

Comment: Did we learn nothing from that first tragic, theatrical release of Blade Runner? But it was more than the non-stop, repetitive narration that was problematic. Michael Fassbender was fine, but the character was flat and never seemed in any real danger. For a director normally a master at building suspense, the pacing was terminal, and there were zero twists or humor to save the cliched plot. The only fun to be had were the aliases the hitman used.

Rating: 4
Comment: Michael Fassbender's nameless hitman protagonist is an enigma to the world of cinematic hitmen and Fincher protagonists - substituting the prophetic drawls of intimidation for a stoic and silent antagonizer who lets his victims effectively dig their own graves. The monologues are saved for inside the protagonists head - whether it's describing the intricacies of how McDonalds in Paris operate, or the day-to-day slag that comes with being a hitman, a job that Fassbender openly values a good night's sleep over. Told with Fincher's meta-characteristic expert precision, The Killer provides a fresh take of the hitman story, simultaneously flexing Fincher's long-held chops in the thriller genre as well as Michael Fassbender's ability to say a lot while his character says nearly nothing.

Rating: 5
Comment: Non stop tension . Loved the writing . The music of my favorite band The Smiths was a great addition to this deeply brooding movie . Great performances by the actors . Could have had more action . We need a prequel with scenes of hits done successfully . Worth watching . Still looking up some of the facts mentioned here in the narration for accuracy . Highly suggested !

Comment: Gave me good John Wick vibes in the beginning but then it fell apart. After watching the film I was ready to give this a higher rating but then I started to think about the plot and realized it made no sense. Spoilers ahead. So he's in Europe to kill a guy,inner monologues about how much of a pro he is, misses his shot, tells his handler he messed up and then goes home, gets home and finds out his wife/girlfriend (did she even have a name?) got attacked, he hardly reacts to this but then leaves to hunt down her attackers. He goes on killing spree but it's very nonchalant and muted. How whole lot on inner monologuing though, the MC seems to think he's a pro even though he's constantly messing up. At the end of this he finds out that it was his handler that sent the attackers to his home, why? Idk. His handler knew he wasn't home so why send people to his house and then act surprised when he appears pissed off at your office? Maybe instead of spending a quarter of the movie with just him monologuing and sleeping in silence they should have showed us his relationship with his wife, so we can actually care that she was attacked or maybe how he got to become an assassin. I guess this would work as a decent shut your mind off and watch type of action film

Comment: It was a confused mess.  So he misses his target and has to scramble to get out of town. The movie quickly becomes a revenge story instead of a Le Samurai type story about a nihilistic hitman. So after he misses his target, the Lawyer sends two killers to kill the killer. They aren't even able to kill his girlfriend. After their inept attempt, they just go back to their lives? Wouldn't they be hunting the Killer? Wouldn't the lawyer be aware of what happened and at least realize The Killer was coming after him? Maybe get some protection? What's the deal with The Killer's struggle between nihilism and empathy? He's obviously not a nihilistic hitman; that's shown by the feelings he has for his lady I guess? Drugging a dog with Niqull. How original. Never seen that before. The fight in FLA is pretty lousy. I was hoping Tilda Swinton's Q Tip character was going to be nefarious and terrifying.... nope. Just silliness and a waste of a fabulous actress. Their entire exchange was silly and boring. So then he finally gets to the guy who puts the hit out on him (another good actor wasted) and what happens? The Killer decides not to kill him. Why? Because he's developed some empathy on the way? Why ice the cab driver if that's the case? Or is it that he's rich and afraid of being caught? Well, he had no problem trying to kill a rich man in the beginning. Such a letdown. I think The American is a better movie than this. Fincher no doubt delivers style and Yea Fassbender is a fun guy to watch. I could watch Fassbender waiting for the bus for 20 minutes and be entertained. He's that good. But they don't give him much to work with here. The internal monologue he had (and kept repeating) was so silly, pretentious and confused. When you have the writer of 8mm adapt the material it's probably not going to be a great script. I was so excited for this movie. I may read the comic and see if that's any better. Disappointing.

Comment: Fiquei aguardando uma cena de a√ß√£o da namorada do assassino (Magdala), que poderia ter sido no momento em que ela foi atacada e tentou lutar pela sua vida - como ela mesma disse a ele no hospital, inclusive ela disse a ele que "ele teria ficado orgulhoso dela". O roteirista e o diretor poderiam ter aproveitado mais a experi√™ncia dessa talentosa e carism√°tica atriz, e poderia ter sido naquele momento. Mas eu achei as cenas de a√ß√£o at√© boas, e considerei positivo que tiveram o cuidado de n√£o chocar o espectador com uma cena da vingan√ßa atingindo a cachorra Diva, que seria desnecess√°rio.

Comment: 6/10 - A goodish suspense filled thriller but not if I'm gonna watch it again and it could have done with a bit more action.The film starts off with a good character building scene where you learn about the main character who is an assassin (Michael Fassbender.) Shortly after the character is introduced the film shows how his main job went wrong and he has to make a quick escape. This escape scene is quite intense and clever.After returning home the assassin finds out that his friend has been attacked and he now needs to find out who organised the attack before they strike again. This does add a mystery element to the film and when the killer interrogates someone it does add a bit of gore to the film. There is also a good fight scene between the assassin and one of the attackers but unfortunately this is the only fight scene in the film. And the film misses an opportunity to have another shoot 'em up/fight scene when the assassin takes on the 2nd attacker. And the scene where the assassin takes on the 3rd attacker is a bit boring. But overall the film is quite intense and entertaining.

Comment: One of the most forgettable movies I've ever seen. There's no character apart from Fassbender's who has anything to say and he's not at all developed. It's not even mindless action because there's very little action and what's there is utterly predictable. How on earth do they get decent names, good budget, and still come up with such rubbish? Could be written by AI, perhaps.

Rating: 4.5
Comment: Didn't know much about it other than the advert but it was actually pretty good.  I was worried in the first act that it was going to be a one- or two-handler due to COVID-restricted filming but after the culmination of that part it danced along at a decent pace; very cool (Fassbender was very good) and one of THE best soundtracks which made it all a pretty fun watch with slick dialogue and good action scenes.  Well worth a watch.

Rating: 3.5
Comment: This is an odd movie that is not for everyone. The story is very plain, especially for the director, David Fincher, who has done very great story-driven movies. The plot is incredibly straightforward, with no twists or turns. It has uninteresting characters including the non-named main character who we only know anything from his constant monologues throughout. He just monologues about the meticulous nature of work and the same mantra he says to himself to be an assassin. He rarely ever interacts or speaks with any other characters making for a bland character. However, this meticulous nature is how the movie is made as well. You see it in the sleek camera work, gorgeous visuals, hypnotic soundtrack, terrific performance, well-crafted sound design, and mesmerizing violence. It is an oddly interesting film that is worth a watch.

Most seem to rate it higher simply because of the director, and try to dig out desperately anything positive and focus on that istead the fact the movie is terrible. No story, irritating main character with no backstory, nothing to attach to emotionally... You should be impressed by his meticulousness where lack there of gets him into trouble to begin with. Terrible overdubed dialogue throughout the movie, one of the worst i've seen. Especially the one in the taxi scene where it doesn't even match with what taxi driver is saying. Do yourself a favor, stay away.

Comment: Typical RT High Critic/modest Audience score. Critics reward non-Hollywood restraint. Audience calls it like it is. Quality effort in movie making. Poor, unenlightening script. The Killer repeats (and repeats) his mantras for consistency and self control over and over without actually revealing much about himself. His revenge goes without dimension or surprise‚Äîexcept that with everyone else dead, he lets the client off as "insurance," with no evidence that there was actually going to be any other threat source (so go ahead and kill him as your insurance). Not a very rewarding watch, though Fasbender is worth SOME of the time invested.

Comment: David Fincher is easily one of my favorite directors. For the most part, he always makes these gritty and grounded films that look at the darker sides of humanity, and he always makes them absurdly compelling. And The Killer is yet another great disturbing film under his belt.Michael Fassbender is fantastic, the cinematography is gorgeous, the writing is almost always compelling, and the kills are brutally blunt. It is a very slow burn of a movie and I wasn't hugely invested in the reason why the main character went on his revenge journey.But the film is so meticulously crafted in its visuals and its philosophies that I couldn't help but be invested in almost every single second. While I don't think it's one of Fincher's best, it's still pretty damn good, all the same.

Comment: David Fincher is the master! I loved his new film and the idea behind representing a killer who, despite being extremely methodical, giving the impression of being very special, the world is full of people like him. The story is one of Fincher's simplest compared to his other films, but that doesn't make the story bad, the story is very well done, which is impressive to be possible with the number of films with the same idea. The actors also did very well, Fassbender gave full life to his cold and calculating killer, and as for the other actors, even though the appearances were very quick, they didn't waste our time and did very well. The scenes in the film are also impeccable, the cinematography is beautiful, portraying very well all the places the Assassin passes through. This new Fincher film really entertained me and I highly recommend it.

Comment: I don't usually watch movies like The Killer, but it was recommended to me and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Michael Fassbender's performance is outstanding and he carries the movie from beginning to end. The plot may be shallow, but the cinematography, music, and direction more than make up for it. Although it doesn't bring anything new to the table, The Killer is still a great watch and a lot of fun.

Comment: David Fincher's homecoming has been long awaited. His first return to narrator-heavy, visually and emotionally dark tones have been deeply missed in the world of cinema today. Where "Gone, Girl" convinced us that he still "had it" and could flip that switch again, when he was ready; "The Killer" articulates to us that he most certainly is.While "The Killer" might deprive some fans of the dark humor and satire that "Fight Club" delivered, we should be careful in grafted that aspect of Palahniuk's source material and Jim Uhl's source material on Fincher's finished product. "The Killer" is David Fincher's return to everything "Fight Club" is capable of being, if "Fight Club" was a graphic novel written by Alexis Nolentz and Luc Jacamon and was called "The Killer."If youre a fan, you will bask in the nostaligia, giddy from the early moments of Fassbender's voiceovers, loving every moment of the film. If you're not, you're just going to enjoy this film and possibly forget about it within a few hours. This is not a film that I expect to see any Academy Award nominations for, absent maybe - BIG maybe - Fincher, for Best Director. Still, its a solid A- and a great addition to a class of films that are more than on their way to making up for the lackluster set from last season.

Comment: David Fincher is as strong as always, directing a movie with the same precision as his main character. One of the best elements in this film, is the sound design. Sometimes the noise of the environment blends in with or as the score of the movie- which works awesome. My major critique of the story is its lack of motives. The character we follow is intriguing, but WHY is he like this, WHY are some thing important for him, WHY does he have this job. The missing motivational fundament results in an entire movie of suspenseful moments without the urgency it would have with motives. Fun idea, great directing- but forgettable movie.

Comment: Of those who like to put their faith in the inherent goodness of mankind, I have to ask, "Based on what, exactly?"It was visually pretty cool to watch from the opening title shots right to the end. Fassbender was perfect for the role. It wasn't up to other Finder films, but certainly a good watch.It felt like a 90's crime film at times and I say that as a compliment. What I liked was is was about a guy who appears to have no morals, living by a personal moral code.Tilda Swinton was great.Maybe I just have too high of expectations for Fincher, but I never was fully invested in the movie. I am wondering if we will get a sequel. I don't think it is necessary, but they certainly left enough out there to give us one.The comparisons to John Wick are stupid.It was kind of odd to find myself rooting for the assassin.

Rating: 3
Comment: I was very excited to watch this film and the first ten minutes were definitely interesting but sadly that was the high point. We're following an unnamed killer who we know nothing about aside from his logical, measured approach. We have no emotional investment in him so I can't see why we're supposed to care about his romantic partner. The rest of the movie is him looking for revenge, filled with uninteresting characters aside from a few who don't stick around long. This movie would've faired better to have him chasing down his original target and giving us more of the calculated, technical assassin stuff the trailer sold us on. Not a bad movie by any means but I won't ever watch it again.

Comment: "The Killer" is a film that generates more value as one lets it gestate in their mind long after viewing it. What is seen at face value as a dark thriller/comedy about a hitman dealing with blowout of a botched job is actually more nuanced when you piece together the elements Fincher and Walker have presented. "The Killer" is one of Fincher most thoughtful films in its execution and character development. Fassbender brings it home with his lead performance and has the perfect range of indifference and incredulous irritation for a man that is trying hard not to "feel" when his whole mission is based of the validity of his feelings. It's a philosophical story that may not be for everyone (especially the conventional "hitman subgenre" fans) but is definitely worthy of a watch amongst the "Ghost Dog's" and the "Le Le Samoura√Ø's".

Comment: Fabulous Film Of Intrigue, Intense Action And Ironic 1st Person Narrative----------------------------------------Director David Fincher (whose other films include Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010) just to name a few) once again knocked it out of the park with an elegant and detailed screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker adapted from the French graphic novel series of the same name written by Alexis "Matz" Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon. What a fantastic and engaging movie that's sprinkled with suspense and humor and unexpected events.-----------------------------------------The film stars Michael Fassbender in the title role and the film starts out as the first-person narrative of his character talking through is career as an assassin. He does an amazing job with his conviction and technical prowess at how he treats his craft of killing people for hire. Arliss Howard plays one of the billionaire clients who plays nervousness very well. Tilda Swinton gives a short but memorable performance as the link to the client who hired the killer himself. She's witty and charming.---------------------------------------------The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross gave the film its amazing tension and action suspense while holding you at bay until the Killer did his next feet of revenge, basically it's the story of an assassin making a mistake, being personally threatened and then choosing all of his next targets for revenge.----------------------------------------Very well-done film. Small cast, great action-packed believable story with slight humor and suspense keeping you on the edge of your seat!---------------------------------------------Lorenzo M.

Comment: The first fifteen min of the movie passed with no action, nothing but boring, unnecessary inner monologue in a bad American accent. He's on a revenge path but shows no actual anger/desperation/frustration, no emotional connection shown with the person he's supposed to be avenging either. The story gave me no reason to care about ANY of the characters at all, it's just lazy writing.

Comment: Well it's like watch a middle manager get mad at everyone and then kill them but forgive their boss because, no one knows.  Also the fact that the internal monologue was so loud was ridiculous.  Though I guess they get half a star for having the first irl anime fight I've seen.  Man this movie was like all lead up wit no finish then a farewell cut.

Comment: A fresh take on a contract killer. Somebody who has sentiment but absolutely zero empathy. It may shock you but this is what the real world looks like. Expecting empathy from somebody like that is pointless. Because one moment of distraction brought him to this point so he would never not again "anticipate, don't improvise"

Rating: 1
Comment: A good performance from both Fassbender and Swinton can't save this. It's a clich√© jaunt that's part "American Psycho" and part Amateur-Hitman-Instructional-Video that gets weighed down by a voice-over narration of self-contradictory philosophical meanderings. We are forced to listen to aphoristic mantras which the character rarely seems to adhere to, not to mention an anticlimactic ending and amoral, one-dimensional, unsympathetic characters.

Comment: "Quando sara' il tuo momento, non sara' la tua vita a scorrerti davanti, ma la mia". dice una rassegnata Tilda Swinton al suo assassino. E perche' mai mi sono chiesta? Cos'ha questa uccisione di diverso dalle altre? Chi dei due uccide veramente prima l'altro? Cosa contiene, a parte il whisky,  la bottiglia di the Expert ( vi siete chiesti in cosa? ) da cui il killer beve avidamente, dopo essere caduto nella trappola tesa abilmente dalla scaltra assassina? E cos'e' quello spasmo alla palpebra del killer su cui si chiude il film? Il veleno ha cominciato a fare effetto? ( Il tallio forse...)

Comment: I have been lied to I taught from the trailer I would see like a hitman movie with many orders to kill for Fassbender. I got sth completely  different and it was ducking boring imo at times. To sum the movie short (spoiler alert) clean up after duck up and end goodbye thanks for tuning in

Comment: I was looking forward to the movie but I didn't enjoy it. It was flat. I didn't really care what would happen. Also it didn't make logical sense. The killer is supposed to live by rules but when he messes up, he draws outside the lines.

Rating: 2.5
Comment: Imagine Kill Bill, but with no payoff and only one fight scene. It's obviously one of Fincher's man in isolation films, but the script feels like a bad mix between Pulp Fiction rambling and Kill Bill ethos. Gas sender is cold and his interaction with Tilda Swinton in the end is well directed, the general streamlined plot says really nothing about being a hitman except life is boring 90% of the time. And on a side note, the opening voice over quotes satanist and occultist Alister Crowley with the "do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law" and him "forgetting who said that" is weird AF!

Comment: Tense, slow burn, intriguing, filled with moral grays; an extremely pessimistic but overall good film. The directing by Fincher is top-notch, though this is not his best film. The plot simply isn't compelling enough in this "noir-style" tale. But Fassbender is still excellent, as are the other actors/actresses w/ minor roles. Cold, calculated, but not much in the feelings or emotions category, haha. I'm wondering if there is a sequel planned for the future? 4/5 stars

Rating: 1.5
Comment: David Fincher?! As in The Game, Fight Club David Fincher? What happened to make him take on this c-list dreck? The first 20 minutes is composed entirely of dull internal monologue voiceover, the highlight being a visit to McDonalds; there are more Smiths songs than an 80's teenage sleepover; the protagonist is a sociopathic personality vacuum who will murder an innocent taxi driver but forgive a conniving elderly billionaire. The talented actors involved do their best but nothing is going to save this utter waste of two hours short of it being dropped in the sea attached to a brick.

Comment: The movie is pretty to look at and Fassbender does a great job for what the role asks of him, but the movie left me feeling 'Meh'. In summary, its a revenge movie but you never really feel like it is. We don't care about the plot because the care part is never really established to begin with. He's trying to get revenge for his wife/girlfriend almost getting killed but we barely see her or know how much she really means to him in the first place. I plan on watching it again to see if there was something I missed, but I don't think I did. In summary, an OK movie to pass the time but nowhere near as incredible as most of David Fincher's movies usually are.

Rating: 0.5
Comment: Clearly they paid off critics and audience members because this movie was extremely boring, unoriginal and quite lacking in story and character development. Michael fassbender hardly ever talks in the movie, he just narrates affirmations in his head that he doesn't actually use. He is a sloppy hit man that leaves his tracks everywhere and anywhere. I saw a few people leave the theater and thought I'll give it 15 more minutes before I call it a day. The entire 15 minutes was torture. I got up left and asked for a refund or to see another movie which alamo drafthouse denied. Probably won't be heading back to a movie theater in a good while until Hollywood can write a good story and or not completely make it out of CGI.

Rating: 2
Comment: I was so disappointed by this movie.David Fincher is a great director and I've loved most of his previous films. Michael Fassbender is an excellent actor who, unfortunately, chooses a lot of bad films.I thought these two combined in a film about an assassin would result in a tight, suspenseful film.I was so wrong.SPOILER ALERTThe first ten minutes are spent watching him waiting for his target to arrive and listening to him talk, and talk, and talk. The guy never shuts up FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE.When the target arrives, he misses multiple opportunities to take them out but instead waits and waits until finally taking a shot. Then he misses!Why would we think this guy is a competent assassin when the only shot we see him take misses?Then he talks and talks and talks more.His girlfriend, who we no nothing and therefore don't care about at all, is assaulted and he goes after her attackers.Why? Revenge? He keeps telling us about how emotions shouldn't be involved.The support actors are bad. His girlfriend's brother and the taxi driver he finds are awful.He finds one attacker who is a huge guy with a vicious dog. Instead of picking them both off from a distance, he goes in for close combat and gets into a fight with the guy. Why would he put himself at risk like that?He makes terrible decisions.And the product placement! There are actual ads for McDonalds and Amazon DURING THE MOVIE.So he kills the bad guys and his girlfriend gets better and they live happily ever after.I hated this movie.

Rating: 5
Comment: David Fincher has done it again! This film is a meticulously crafted revenge story that is completely free of cliches. The best way I can describe this movie is if you took Daniel Craig's bond and sucked all of the Hollywood stylized action and romance out of his films. What you are left with is a cold blooded killer who will take you out without a second of hesitation. This movie is without a doubt the most realistic depiction of what a real hitman would be like. The only comparable media that comes close is the show barry, but that show leans more into comedy, where as this movie is stone cold serious. It will not be for everyone, but for the few who want to see a visceral and realistic depiction of a man with no remorse on a revenge path, you will have a hard time finding another movie like it.

Rating: 5
Comment: The most dialogue free movie that I've ever seen next to Mad Max Fury Road. Yet, it doesn't matter. Fincher and Fassbender manage to walk you through this very very intimate journey of a hitman with a driven purpose... But you've got to watch it to understand what that is. I'll be watching this many more times to pick up on things I missed.

Comment: I was looking forward to this, being a fan of both Tilda Swinton and Michael Fassbender but sorry to report that The Killer didn't cut it for me. Good aesthetics and photography (as can be expected with Fincher) and the actors are really doing their best with the (absence of) story they're given to work with, but the first 30 minutes are completely parasited by a deeply uninspired and verbose voiceover -- killing any sense of interest for the main character -- and the rest of the film is basically following him through a vengence quest we're never (as an audience) given anything to root for. The anti John Wick film for sure, but in the worst possible way. What happened there?

Comment: Love Fincher's past work. This movie isn't as great as some of his previous movies. Michael Fassbender was great playing ruthless and emotionless killer. The reason for this rating is that story doesn't have enough tension, it doesn't make me lose concept of time and be focused on it through out the movie like in case of some of the previous movies by this director. The fact that I don't see in which direction the story could go in the case of a sequel, which seems very possible is also one of the reasons for good but not great, three and a half stars.

"nothing matters" except living like the 1% rich apparently.

Comment: It seems the idea behind the main character was to show this sort of unremarkable, neurodivergent person that could realistically become a contract killer. While Fassbender performs this role well, I think the idea is flawed, it's just boring. Some of the plot choices are questionable, like others have said you don't really feel vested in what's happening, and the movie is sprinkled with what I can only describe as moronic philosophy that feels desperate to be insightful.

Rating: 3
Comment: Absolutely beautiful movie, great detail, visuals, and acting. Dialogue was great as well. The action was inventive and well-directed. However, the story is kind of a stinker. For a movie this well-made, it's a shame that it couldn't tell a more interesting story.

Rating: 2.5
Comment: I wanted to like it, but we've seen everything that happens in the movie a million times. The meticulous assassin, neurotic inner monologue, deadpan stare as his victims rationalize with their imminent demise - it's just all been done too many times. You can't drop a movie like this without something/someone to *really* carry it forward, and unfortunately, Fassbender's character could've been played by anyone. He's Patrick Bateman, but without the hilariously insane personality. John Wick without the dominating presence (and accuracy lol). That said, it's clear they were going for something more down to Earth, but the result was dry and unengaging.

Rating: 1
Comment: The script is so terrible. It's boring. There's no real story. No plot. And we're expected to root for this horrific character who murders people with no questions asked as long as he gets paid? He kills two innocent people he didn't need to. The beginning VO drones ON and ON and ON what seems like forever. And what he says, his supposed iron-clad mantra, is the exact opposite of what his character does. The script is written as if two frat bros got together, got super high, and just wrote every cliche line they've ever heard in a movie about a hitman. Thumbs down.

Rating: 4
Comment: "The Killer" presents a nuanced blend of David Fincher's stylized approach and the action elements reminiscent of John Wick, albeit in a more subdued manner that eschews superhero tropes. Michael Fassbender delivers an excellent performance, embodying his character with skill. While some scenes may drag, featuring Fassbender engaged in seemingly mundane activities like yoga or sleeping, Fincher succeeds in grounding the characters within a tangible reality. The film, enjoyable overall, diverges from the expectation of a continuous, action-packed narrative, encouraging viewers to appreciate its more measured pace and focus on character depth over relentless action sequences.

Comment: Usual action story seems to be just a figure in the powerfully elegant, cold-hearted atmosphere. The Killer is a complete movie which uses precise style to link the actor, scenario and music.

Comment: very disappointing. so many companies PR and he didn't act like spy at all.

Rating: 3
Comment: 67%. Basically he misses on a hit then his employer has his colleagues go after him and his wife. Then he seeks revenge on them and then the client who ordered the hit. The self narration gets kind of old. Kind of cool to see him sneak around to find ways to kill them but really not all that great of a plot or action. 1.5/5 rewatch.

Comment: I'm a huge fan of Fincher, and his dark, moody style comes through perfectly here. Fassbender does a nice job assuming the role of an emotionless hitman too. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross add the perfect soundtrack too. At times, the pace moved a little slowly, but overall, another great David Fincher flick. Recommended for any fan of his work.

Comment: It is most definitely not Fincher's best movie, and it lacks the star power on the acting scale. However, this movie's true star is David Fincher, as his dedication and caring for the details are remarkable!! the cinematography is amazing, and the sound editing and music utilization were perfect!! Not everyone will notice all the details of Fincher's craft, but as an example, when we are in our character's shoes and see the events from his point of view, we would hear the music and feel everything like him, while when we are looking from the outside, we would feel things from the outside. This movie is deeper than it may seem, and the restaurant scene with "the expert" was so amazing, and Tilda Swinton acted astonishingly, like she was born to deliver this performance! This scene and conversation (though it is more of a monologue) reminded me of famous restaurants and coffeeshops conversation scenes. In conclusion, "The killer" isn't the most revolutionary and renewing film, however it is much deeper than mainstream revenge movies and it is well-crafted and well-detailed.

Comment: Movie has plot holes for example it didn't bother him that he missed the target. It bothered him to pay the price for missing it. When it comes to revenge he lost control and didnt care much if he caught in the camera for example when he took the taxi at the station to interrogate and killing the driver. someone took a taxi to bust into his house and beat up his girl friend. A taxi???There are far better movies to watch. its a shame Micheal chose this script to return.

Comment: Well done.  Moves quickly.  Like the voiceover, the humor of the lines, and acting.

Comment: Terrible script. And if a movie's script sucks, nothing can save it--including great cinematography, acting, and soundtrack (which this movie has). I couldn't make it past the half-way point because I wasn't invested in any of the characters--especially not the lead character, who is a sort of boring monologue robot assassin who has still not had a single meaningful conversation with anyone over an hour into the movie. I love Fincher, but this is a terrible movie.

Comment: Very cold and unsettling, it's a great movie. Kept me interested, I didn't think of the actors as actors once, but rather as characters and the choreography and fight scenes were incredible.

Comment: Lightweight Fincher.  It's VERY nice to look at.  Gorgeous color palettes and mood lighting.  Tense experimental soundtrack from Trent & Atticus is always a plus.  Michael Fassbender is a natural for this role.  These are all good things.Story is where it goes sideways.  Assassin following a trail of breadcrumbs.  We've seen it a million times.  There's really no substance underneath anything here.  And Fassbender's constant philosophical ramblings throughout the film are just empty minded cliches.  A little heavy handed on all the 80's nostalgia too.  Fincher loves The Smiths, who knew?Oooops, forgot, the fight with The Brute was solid.

Comment: Boring. It was trying to be too cool and clever for its own good, but the result was boring, slow, and predictable. Nothing interesting happens and it's not a satisfactory ending. The character has no personality to like/care about, so you don't care what happens.

Comment: Plotholes. Tilda Swinton is underused. The fight scene and Reznor score kept it afloat but the script was lacking. That being said, Fassbender was excellent

Comment: I'm a big fan of David Fincher's movies; sadly, this isn't one of his best. Still, it's worth a look.

Comment: Another Masterpiece from director David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker. This movie is as good as 'Seven'. I loved every moment of it! I highly recommend.

Comment: Was there any plot?How many scenes did they copy from other films?Oh, the first hit was in Paris to give it an international theme, but otherwise it was just generic American pap.Awful.

Rating: 3
Comment: The soundtrack was immense, but, for me, the film itself was too one note. It starts well and you get the feeling you're in for another show of David Fincher's class, but it rarely gets out of second gear and, is essentially, just a collection of similar scenes strung together without aplomb. Fassbender fails to shine and character development is basically non-existent. Style over substance. Shame
