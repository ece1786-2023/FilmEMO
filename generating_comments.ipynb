              " '[i]review by efrain gomez[/i]\"Wake up!!\" Petey Greene is gonna tell you like it is. From the first line to the closing shot, \"Talk to Me\" grabs us and takes us on a trip to P-Town through the true story of sharp-tongued Petey Greene (Don Cheadle), a felon-turned radio personality and social rights activist in 1960\\'s Washington D.C.(P-Town) and his friendship with a radio station bigwig, Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor, \"Children of Men\"). After Lorton Prison\\'s slick-talking resident disc-jockey, Petey, walks out early on a deal with the warden, he pursues a job on the outside in the only thing he can do that isn\\'t illegal - radio. Dewey, an executive at WOL-AM radio, gives Petey a chance by putting him on the air.  Petey quickly becomes the voice of the people in the Washington D.C. area, a largely black population, because his wise-cracking tell-like-it-is wit spoke out against racism and poverty. Petey Greene was a megaphone for so many people who couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be heard because they were either taught to hush up all their lives or because they were too afraid to speak up. This brings to mind the current state of the world, where we still have the freedom and opportunity to speak out against injustice.  In many ways this movie is a standard biopic of an obscure historical figure ripe for a revival in social awareness, but the true merit of the film lies in the simple but profound brotherly love between Petey and Dewey. This element is the heart of \"Talk to Me\", coloring outside the lines of traditional Hollywood films. Their relationship reminds me a little of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in how the bond of true friendship is something that outlasts the tests of time, no matter how tempestuous (and alcohol-ridden) it may be. National Public Radio\\'s Tavis Smiley felt it was one of the best movies he\\'d seen in the past five years. I disagree, but \"Talk to Me\" is still a cool, colorful portrait of the ex-con-turned-shock-jock-and-social-activist, Petey Greene, the man who kept it real and outrageous, spewing truth over the air waves to the hot and to the cold, to the young and to the old. ------Rating',\n",

Cheadle and Ejiofor\\'s performances are the highlights of the movie, particularly Cheadle\\'s charismatic leading turn as 1960s Washington DC radio host Ralph Walden \"Petey\" Greene. Cheadle\\'s energy makes the first half of the movie fairly entertaining, with his chemistry with Ejiofor\\'s Dewey Hughes the best part of the film. It\\'s too bad that their performances are contained in yet another standard-fare biopic that overall serves as an exercise in banality.The movie tells the story of Greene, an ex-con who becomes a popular radio host and eventual civil rights activist. The movie spans his life from his time in prison in 1965 through his time on the radio and television until his death in 1984, detailing his friendship with producer Dewey Hughes.Unfortunately, what could be a different take on the civil rights movement and a look at a prominent African American cultural figure, the type that generally goes ignored by history, ends up being the same old rise, fall, and redemption biopic we\\'ve seen time and time again, this time with a really great soul soundtrack. Cheadle and Ejiofor are game, but Lemmons direction is completely uninspiring, resulting in a film that lasts about half an hour too long, feeling like a vanity project for executive producer Cheadle.It\\'s certainly not a terrible project, the performances are too strong for that, and the civil rights theme gives it a touch of resonance.

I started to realize I didn't care what happened to any of the characters about 1 hour into the movie. I knew everything would be tied in a pretty bow. There was no life to the storytelling--it was just event after event and fact-based storytelling ignoring the life of the characters. It seems the filmmakers concentrated on presenting a watered down, historical telling of his life rather than examining Petey's persona. It makes me wonder if the filmmakers and producers didn't really want to delve into the issues behind the event-based narrative. Despite a few strong performances (Taraji P. Henson and Chiwetel Ejiofor) propping the film up, it played to the dumbest TV movie style elements (MLK assassination pandering, Forrest Gumpian 1960s nostalgia) and forgot about Petey's larger than life personality in many ways. The movie took the facts of his life and the historical context and slapped the audience upside the head with them. There was no mystery, no fun.

It looked like a film with a horribly interesting plot that focused on the career of Petey Greene, an outspoken Washington DC dj from the streets. He told it like it was...and now I\\'m going to tell it like it is. This movie is trash. If you have seen Dewey Cox, then you have seen most of Talk to Me. It is the stereotypical, biographical, rags-to-riches story that we have seen about 1 million times in the last five years. Can no one be original with biographies anymore??? It seems the director, writers, whoever else was responsible for this crap, etc. could not decide whether or not to make this a biography. Were they going to focus on a span of a few months as they did for about...oh i dont know...the whole first hour and a half of the film? OR were they going to try and span his entire career...like they tried to do unsuccessfully for the last half hour or so. Choose one or the other, but please, spare the audience next time. Make up your mind. Is it going to be his entire life or just the start of his career? The creators of this crap could not decide, obviously. I personally would have liked to only seen the beginning of his career. After Greene became a sellout, this movie turned to dust. They should have stuck with the beginning. I would have been fine not knowing that he sold out later. As for the performances...this could get ugly. I will go ahead and get this out of the way first. Don Cheadle is above this film. He was superb in every way. It\\'s just that this script was below his caliber of acting. It gave him crap to work with, and was it just me, or did I notice his energy start to fade as the script got worse? Maybe he realized how hokie and terrible the whole thing was. I wish I could say that Chiwetel Ejiofor is ready for a lead role, but he isn\\'t in my book. You need a much stronger actor to fill a role this large. I was very disappointed with his performance. In fact, I kind of wanted to toss everyone out except for Cheadle and Martin Sheen. Still, I think this work was below both of those actors. And I really did not like the girlfriend either. I do not know who played her, but does it really matter? She was portrayed as a stereotype, and i think it would be an insult to my race if i took on a role that was written that way. Her character played right into the parody that was so masterfully spoofed in Dewey Cox by Jenna Fishcer. You all know what I mean. It\\'s the \"wife of the star who ages pretty comically throughout the film\" thing. It\\'s never effective, and it certainley wasn\\'t here. I know I have been pretty harsh on this film, but it teased me. It started out so promising, and just kept getting worse and worse. The final half hour of the film was a mockery of an \"inspired by true events\" movie. Terrible. Just terrible. Poor acting, poor script, poor everything. The dialogue was especially cheesy and made it difficult to finish the film. I cannot say many good things about this film other than Don Cheadle is amazing. His performance was not enough to save the film though. The Martin Luther King Jr. sequence is pretty brilliant, though. That is the one part of this film that got a thumbs up from me. Very well exectued. Too bad it would all go down hill from there. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst films I saw in 2007. Wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. I find the film stereotypical, insulting, and unfulfilling.',\n",

First time I really heard about him was when this trailer premiered, so who am I to say this movie is accurate?  Well, I Wikipedia'd the guy.  That gave me nothing because Wikipedia is well...Wikipedia.  (Soon Flixster will allow me to critique everything I see in day-to-day life.)  The filmmaking is pretty solid.  With the exception of some choices stylistically, I have to say that it is pretty straight-forward.  The movie does cover the span of some twenty-plus years and this movie successfully conveys that without seeming boring.  Trust me, pacing goes a long way with me.  So good job so far, <i>Talk to Me</i>.  But like most biopics, this film felt like a Hollywood interpretation of something very real.  I have to state first is that I hated the forced comedy in this movie.  I totally agree that comedy is just a part of real life, but this was so scripted and trying to be funny that it came off as slightly desperate.  But when it came to the drama?  Top notch for the most part.  It was really interesting and human and that is what you are looking for in a film like this.  But like all Hollywood dramas, there comes that moment where the movie tries pushing buttons instead of being organic.  There's the infamous speech moment between two characters.Gah, why do they have to do that?Anyway, the movie has a really rich feel to it.  I have to attribute this to the visual and auditory style of the movie.  Yes, the lead actors were fantastic, but nothing earth shattering came out of their performances.
